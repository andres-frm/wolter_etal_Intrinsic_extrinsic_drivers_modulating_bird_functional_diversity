This repository contains the `R` scripts for estimating functional diversity metrics (`FD_metrics.R`) and procedures to fit the models (`data_analysis.R`). It also includes the annotated code reproducing data wrangling, modeling, and simulations (i.e., Supporting information S2; file: `supplementary_material_S2.qmd`) from __Wolter et al__. Once the manuscript is accepted, the raw data and code will be stored in a public repository (e.g. Dryad, Zenodo) that ensures they are discoverable, freely reusable, and citable.

__File description:__

- `FD_metrics.R`: `R` script for calculating functional diversity metrics.
- `data_analysis.R`: `R` script reproducing modelling procedure, simulations and results plotting.
- `supplementary_material_S2.qmd`: file for generating _Supporting information S2_.
